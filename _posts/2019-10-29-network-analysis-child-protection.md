I worked with the researchers from Te Punaha Matatini to predict child abuse [using family network data in child protection services.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224554)

We used network-based variables such as:
- the total number of individuals in the child’s family network
- the number of individuals in the network with at least one notification to the child protection services
- the number of individuals in the network with at least one prior intervention or finding of maltreatment
- the number of individuals in the network who are recorded as having instigated at least one abusive relationship 

The aim of the study was not to develop an operational model. But we want to show that existing models could be improved by including this additional information. The key findings are:
- at the time of a notification, especially the crucial first notification received about a given child, relationship data were often absent because they were not recorded by child protection services until after a serious event, such as a referral or intervention. 
- some of these relationships (parent/child, sibling and half-sibling) are “whole-life relationships” that may be available from other data sources, for example birth records. 
- we backdated these relationships to simulate child protection services having access to a national database containing birth records.
