One of my favourite things to do is to help data scientists who are at the beginning of their career.

I have attended:
- University of Canterbury's Career Fair
- Canterbury Tech mentoring programme
- [SIGNAL's Tech Careers & Pizza Night](https://signal.ac.nz/shift/shift-industry-projects/article/Mxdd5H6/guest-speakers-the-highlight-of-2019-pizza-nights)
