[Algorithms are everywhere but the public sector seems scared to use them](https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/108106300/algorithms-are-everywhere-but-the-public-sector-seems-scared-to-use-them) interviews me as a public servant turned corporate citizen. 
- The article very much reflects what I see as the positive outlook of using algorithms in the public sector 
- I was worried about how the reporter would quote me out of context. But it turned out she was pinpoint accurate
- It was also my first time being interviewed on national paper
