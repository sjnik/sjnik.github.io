INT. ALLY'S HOUSE - CLOSE ON CELL PHONE - EARLY MORNING

WE'RE LOOKING AT A YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THEIR DUET.

WOLFIE: What's that number down here?

MATTY: That is how many people looked at it.

And we see Lorenzo's racetrack and driver compadres are
clustered together in Ally's living room, as one of them
is holding a cell phone for the others to see...

WOLFIE: Get the fuck outta here. How do they know how many people looked at it?

LITTLE FEET: They call it an algorithm...

WOLFIE: What's an algorithm?

MATTY: It’s like a beat.

WOLFIE: A beat?

MATTY: Yeah.

WOLFIE: Like in music, a beat?

MATTY: Yeah.

Lorenzo comes in and sees what they’re looking at...

LORENZO: Do you believe this? And you see this?

He points to the growing number on the screen.

WOLFIE: Yeah.

LORENZO: That's how many people have watched.

WOLFIE: Yeah, yeah, we...

MATTY: We were telling him.

WOLFIE: How the fuck do they do that?

LORENZO: I watched it two hundred times myself. I'm two hundred of those people.
