The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) initiated a piece of research on how to expand the predictive model we have [previously built]({% post_url 2018-05-14-predicting-student-dropout %}) to more (even all) tertiary institutes in NZ. 

We [published a paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-1699-3_20), which was presented at the 17th Australasian Conference on Data Mining (AusDM 2019) held in Adelaide, Australia.
