The Tertiary Education Commission (TEC) initiated a piece of research on how to expand the predictive model we have [previously built](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/103721516/this-machine-learning-algorithm-claims-to-know-which-students-are-going-to-drop-out) to more (even all) tertiary institutes in NZ. 

By surfacing the predictions to the universityâ€™s student retention team, the university can intervene and support at-risk students at the best time. Students get to maximise their potential while the university optimises their cost of intervention and loss of revenue.

The main effort here is to stocktake the common data from more TEOs and join them up with our bespoke pre-processing. As in our previous work, the core part of data is still student's demographics and the details of enrolment history. We are gathering more data options from the tertiary institues such as attendance, results and online courses completion.
