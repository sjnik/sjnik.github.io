<p>I have been a data science praticioner since 2013.</p>

<p>I bring a unique view that combines my experience in the public sector, private sector, and research. In other words, I have been:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a data scientist at Ministry of Social Development in Wellington, NZ</li>
  <li>the Head of Machine Learning at Jade Software in Christchurch, NZ</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, I was a medical physics student with MARS Bioaimaging at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, NZ.</p>

<p>This is a collection of published materials that I have been contributing to.</p>
