    <p>Working with Harrison Grierson, a construction planning company based in Tauranga, we provided a document-recommender machine learning service. Using text analytics, the machine learning model “reads” and analyses documents from thousands of past projects to recommend those that are most related to the document currently being viewed. The filtered list of recommendations enables knowledge sharing across the country in addition to saving engineers and planners significant time searching and browsing through projects and folders manually.</p>

<p>In the proof of concept, we extracted texts from more than 2500 Microsoft Word documents and PDFs within 30 sample projects. For each of the documents, we compiled a list of keywords by counting occurence of a word in the document and normalising the occurrence to a wider collection of documents (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">TF-IDF</a> is the technical term). We fed the keywords into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastText">Facebook’s text library</a> to compare the meaning of the keywords in 300 dimensions. Each dimension has its own explanation e.g. gender, royalty, sports etc or combinations of these.</p>

<p>Apart from the common English words which are not included as keywords by default, we worked with the engineers and planners on the words that are common in the industry that should be ignored (such as company names). 
We have also built a <a href="https://jadeai.shinyapps.io/recommenderdemo">user interface</a> (email me for access) that recommends keyword, document and project that are most related. When the planners and engineers from Harrison Grierson look up say 3 primary keywords, the machine learning model recommends what other keywords they may be interested in. The plot below shows the 3 primary keywords (big blue dots) and how they are interconnected in this two-degree network. Each of the 3 keywords has 2 layers of 6 most-related keywords. The two layers are coloured orange or green respectively. Hovering over the dots in user interface will tell the users which word each of the dots represents.

<h3 id="surfacing-similar-documents-and-similar-projects">Surfacing similar documents and similar projects</h3>
<p>Based on keywords and keywords with similar meaning, we surfaced similar documents. Similar documents mean a pair of documents with matching keywords or keywords with similar meaning within the 300 dimensions. Subsequently, similar projects are simply projects with high number of similar documents.</p>
