I have been a data science praticioner since 2013.

I bring a unique view that combines my experience in the public sector, private sector, and research. In other words, I have been:
- a data scientist at Ministry of Social Development in Wellington, NZ
- Head of Machine Learning at Jade Software in Christchurch, NZ

Previously, I was a medical physics student with MARS Bioaimaging at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, NZ.
